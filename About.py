st.write("""Sephora stands as the preeminent luxury goods conglomerate globally, boasting best-in-class e-commerce experiences. Beside reaching customers through channels such as Facebook Live Shopping, and Instagram Checkout, Sephora has also prioritised digital means such as integrating in-store technologies to engage clients, and personalizing product or service recommendations based on customer data. Furthermore, in todayâ€™s social media fueled world, global brands tag an additional premium to monitor reviews and feedback and quickly act on them. This ability to turnaround the feedback gives brands an edge over their competitors. However, given the large number of products offered by Sephora, and its global presence, this means that Sephora must sieve through large swaths of data and get them to the relevant departments.  
As such, in alignment its core values and business trajectory, Sephora should leverage a data-driven approach, applying text analytics to sort through large amounts of reviews and feedback, so the management can strive to enhance customer satisfaction and foster greater customer loyalty. The intent would be to channel these reviews to the relevant departments for them to act upon them, improving the turnaround time experienced by the customer.""")
