"I use this with the Nudestix â€œCitrus Clean Balm & Make-Up Meltâ€œ to double cleanse and it has completely changed my skin (for the better). The make-up melt is oil based and removes all of your makeup super easily. I follow-up with this water based cleanser, and I also use this just by itself when Iâ€™m not wearing make-up. It leaves the skin gently cleansed, but without stripping the skin. 10/10 recommend combining with the make-up melt. Itâ€™s perfection!",1
My review title says it all! I get so excited to get into bed and apply this lip mask. I do see a difference because I suffer from dry cracked lips. I drink a lot of water and apply lip balm daily but nothing helped until I started using this. untiluntistafted usinf this.,1
Iâ€™ve always loved this formula for a long time. I honestly donâ€™t even use it for night time. I use it as an everyday lip balm. I love the texture. Gummy Bear is my second most favourite scent. Grapefruit is the best in my opinion.,1
"If you have dry cracked lips, this is a must have. After a few weeks of use I have learned I will always have by my bedside. I thought it was a little expensive but a little goes a long way. It is worth the price.",1
I use this at night or while Iâ€™m putting makeup on. Love the way I donâ€™t have to reapply it during the night. Definitely a win.,1
"I love this stuff. I first had the sample size from a Sephora Birthday gift, and once I had run through it I knew it was a purchase. I live in an incredibly dry environment, great for macarons, but terrible for my skin. This lip mask helps to keep my lips from becoming too chapped.",1
"I purchased the Sweet Candy scent at my local Sephora and I am OBSESSED!! I will be honest, the scent is a bit strong - but theyâ€™re all strongly scented. My lips are so soft. 10/10!",1
this product is a bit pricey but after using one scoop i figured this will take a LONG time to use up the whole container. it smells so good and the container is so cute.,1
I use this every night and morning and it works wonders! This never fails to make my lips super hydrated! The tint and shine to it makes it even a great lip gloss during the day!,1
"I just got this a few days ago, itâ€™s amazing! I love the berry scent ! Itâ€™s very hydrating and my lips are so smooth and glossy . My lips are always chapped and dry this has really helped!",1
i love how hydrating this makes my lips feel! perfect for an overnight lip mask or just a gloss as well! lasts forever,1
"i have used this for about almost a year, and my lips are so soft once i use this! not only do i use it at night, but just when i need a quick moisturizing pick up for my lips :)",1
"I have this in every colour except for sweet candy which will be my next purchase but I got the kit with the 5 minis for christmas and I honestly love these so much, I wake up and my lips are instantly smooth, I can also use it as a lipgloss and itâ€™s honestly my favourite lip product ever.",1
I just started using it but from the first night my lips felt way better. The next morning they even looked fuller which Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s the intention but still! And the berry smell is so good!,1
This lip balm is the best I ever had. It works. It hydrates and last long. It has everything you need in a balm. It even has a little spatula that you can use to scoop the product easily and cleanly.,1
Super hydrating and smells really good unlike certain lip masks,1
Love this!!! Iâ€™m obsessed with the Gummy bear scent. This stuff is so thick and creamy. Lasts for hours.  Very hydrating. Loved it so much I bought the daytime gloss! Candy also smells amazing!!!,1
"This product is amazing! I use it before bed, and also throughout the day as a lip balm. Itâ€™s so smooth and feels amazing! It doesnâ€™t have a sticky feeling at all. My lips are soft and smooth since adding this my routine. I will definitively be purchasing again.",1
It is so moisturizing and keeps my lips super soft and hydrated.,1
"I am super impressed with this lip mask. I use it at bedtime and wake up with soft lips! ( I struggle with cracked and peeling lips every winter ) I also use it on top of my lip liner in the morning for a plumped, soft look.",1
"love this so much! I use it everyone night and it keeps my lips so hydrated because they used to always be so dry and chapped! 5 stars, 100% recommend!",1
Obsessed with this! The first few days I wasnâ€™t seeing ton of results but after using it consistently for a bit my lips are no longer chapped. I donâ€™t have to reapply chapstick throughout the day. My lips also look fuller! Wasnâ€™t excited about the price but a small amount works well.,1
"Iâ€™ve never used this kind of product, I tend to be very minimalist. After 1 night, I was already so impressed I had it mailed to a girlfriend as a gift. as far as scents go, if youâ€™re shopping online - all of the other ones are strong smells, it all smells like 90s chapstick. This one is milder, easier to go to sleep next to someone imho",1
My lips were always so dry but this product made them so soft and hydrated. I put it on at night but also during the day over a lip tint. Love it!,1
"It works, makes my lips soft so I donâ€™t need to use chapstick throughout the day. Sometimes I use it as lip-gloss instead of a night mask.",1
Literally love all of Laneige products. The lip sleeping mask has an amazing slip and itâ€™s just the perfect overnight mask. Not sticky at all.,1
"Iâ€™ve had this lip sleeping mask for over a year now and it is the best overnight lip mask. When applied to my lips, it feels super soft and does not feel sticky. When I wake up, my lips are super soft and smooth. 10/10 get it now.",1
"So good. I love the smell and I bought 3 times to use this product, we can use this lip sleeping mask in half a year, it is not expensive for 0.70.",1
Amazing!!! My lips literally react so badly to every single lip balm or chapstick. I had a allergic reaction to jack black spf lip balm and this saved my lips!! They are super soft and moisturized (:,1
I use this every single night right before I go to bed and it leaves my lips super smooth in the morning!,1
"I have these in vanilla and sweet candy. I use them every day, multiple times a day. They hydrate much better than standard lip balms, and they last forever. Iâ€™ve definitely had them for over a yearâ€”they they donâ€™t change in consistency or effectiveness.",1
This product is amazing. It really does smell likes gummy bears and leaves the best moisturizing feeling for a period of time. Stays shiny like a gloss,1
"This product is a DEFINITE must for chapped lips! I get really chapped lips when Iâ€™m stressed out, especially in the winter and it saved my life!",1
Love it!!!! Use it every night and it keeps my lips juicy throughout the whole day even in winter storms #canada. Highly recommend (it tastes great too),1
Iâ€™ve been using this for over 2 weeks now and itâ€™s sooooo good. keeps my lips baby soft and it smells so nice and sweet too. 10/10 recommend,1
It keeps my lips so glossy & hydrated !!! You can use as lip gloss if you want too :))),1
"Je ne comprenais tellement pas pourquoi tout le monde se lanÃ§ait sur ce produit jusquâ€™a ce que je lâ€™essaie moi-mÃªme. Il hydrate tellement bien les lÃ¨vre, il sent trop bon est nâ€™est pas dÃ©sagrÃ©able. Perso, je le porterais jour comme nuit, avec mes lÃ¨vres sÃ¨ches, ce produit me donne lâ€™impression de renaÃ®tre. En plus, il vient avec un petit applicateur, donc pas besoin dâ€™avoir le doigt tout gras en prÃ©lÃ¨vent dedans. Jâ€™adore! Je ne pourrais plus mâ€™en passer! Il devrait toutes fois sortir plus dâ€™odeur qui sont plus douce.",1
"love her! as a sleeping mask, i donâ€™t think you could ask for anything better",1
"Amazing product for dry lips. It is a mask, so you apply before bed then wipe excess in the morning. It smells so good you just wanna chew your lips off(I wont of course lol). Great product for out of control dry lips like mine!",1
Really like this product for before bed. Itâ€™s super hydrating and doesnâ€™t feel tacky. The scents are great too!,1
"This is now my second time purchasing this product. It is super hydrating, also nice to wear during the day as well.",1
Within just a few days of using this lip mask my dry lips from the cold dry winter feel so much better. Not overly greasy and easy to sleep with it on,1
Love this lip masks so much I bought so many other flavours and if you have been thinking about getting it just buy it. It is literally so good. I would literally spend all my money on this. Iâ€™m not joking itâ€™s literally amazing. ï¿¼,1
I love this product because it keeps by lips really hydrated in the cold weather!,1
"Received a sample and had to buy the full size immediately after I finished it. Iâ€™ve used a lot of Blistex and other chapsticks, and I think this really helped heal my chapped lips. Definitely recommend!",1
"I know this doesnâ€™t work for everyone but it sure works for me! I use it at night and wake up to moisturized lips. A big caveat is that if Iâ€™m not drinking water (ie. that time I lost my water bottle for three days), there is no amount of lip balm that will fix my dry lips. Also, if you like the Japanese grape flavour, this is what the balm smells like exactly. Which in my case, is the perfect scenario. Not greasy or sticky and no flavour if you eat it. A little goes a long way imo so the price is a good deal for me.",1
Iâ€™ve repurchased many times make sure to keep spatula so you donâ€™t use your fingers so you donâ€™t get bacteria in it,1
This has really helped my dry lips especially in the winter. A must have in my routine!,1
"I adore this product. It is perfect for any time of the day. I used to wear it only before I went to sleep, and it would make my lips so soft by the morning. Now I also use it as lip gloss during the day. It makes my lips look very glossy and plump, similarly to when I wear the Dior lip oils.",1
Hydrating and smells super yummy. Iâ€™ll use this as a quick hydrator while Iâ€™m doing makeup if I know Iâ€™m putting on lipstick. This little jar will go a long way. Also love that it comes with an applicator.,1
my lips have been dry and flake for as long as i can remember. i finally got this and aquaphor and finally noticed a difference. in one night my lips were smooth and every since then have not flaked.,1
"This product is so cute, especially with the little applicator for your lips. It keeps my lips hydrated really good, and I absolutely love this product. ï¿¼",1
I love the feeling of all of lanieges lip masks and was so excited to try this one Yummy candy but not too overpowering,1
I use this night and morning and LOVE it. This tub lasts SO long too!!,1
"its good, i like it, it lives up to the hype. nothing more nothing less. also why tf are we spending $24 on lip balm lol ?!",1
good for use all day not just for night made my lips sooo soft,1
I love everything laneige and this is no exception. Living in the Midwest in the winter this has literally SAVED my lips from being cracked and sore all winter!,1
Itâ€™s the holy grail of lip hydration. I donâ€™t love the applicator though and feel like it could easily be in a tube instead.,1
itâ€™s nice but buy the amazon dupe. Also the application is a bit difficult. They have one with the squeeze tube thatâ€™s better,1
"Im the type of person that bites and picks on my lips constantly, and I decided to give this products a try and  apply it the second I go to bed. Few days my lips have never felt so soft",1
"Obsessed. Iâ€™ve used the Berry, Mango, and Gummy Bear scents and I love them. I use every night and can still feel them on my lips in the morning. A definite must have.",1
Truly nourishing and very sexy wet look too. I use it before going out during winter days,1
I think itâ€™s worth the price because Iâ€™ve been using it for about a year and I still have some even though I put a lot on at night and sometimes during the day. It works really well for me and lips feel so soft and moisturizedï¿¼ when i wake up,1
"i loveeeee this mask!!! it instantly makes my lips hydrated and i wake up to smooth, soft lips! a little goes a long way and this will definitely last a while! i definitely recommend!",1
Love!! So moisturizing and cute. Love putting it on before I go out or before bed and it leaves my lips feeling soft for hours!!,1
"Love this product. I use it at night and wake up with hydrated lips, smooth and plump. Best lip mask Iâ€™ve ever used",1
Iâ€™ve used this every night for 3 months and I still have so much product left! I can still feel it on my lips in the morning and itâ€™s left feeling super soft! Itâ€™s a staple in my skincare routine <3,1
Iâ€™ve been using this product for years and love it! The peppermint has a nice tingle and smells amazing! 100% will repurchase if it comes back!,1
"Excellent produit ! Lâ€™apparence de mes lÃ¨vres a changÃ© aprÃ¨s 1 semaine dâ€™utilisation. Plus hydratÃ©es, moins rouges et plus uniformes.",1
"The winter time always leaves my lips dry but when you add wind and freezing cold temperatures, my lips become chapped and irritated. Laneige has become a staple in my makeup bag. In fact, I have one in my purse and in my car as well. I saw a difference in just using it a few times. It deeply hydrates my lips. I feel relief instantly. No more chapped lips for me. I highly recommend this product. All of the scents are great! Gummy bear is my favorite.",1
"Iâ€™ve been using this for 3 months, and it has saved my dry, cracked lips. my lips are always sore, bleeding, and cracked. after using this, I have been waking up with really soft lips. 10/10",1
"I live with this mask on my lips all winter long. I live in a cold, dry environment and most lip balms and chapsticks donâ€™t help. I apply a thick layer of this lip mask on nightly and some days I will apply it throughout the day and I havenâ€™t experienced chapped lips at all this winter. It has even saved my lips when Iâ€™ve forgotten to use it for a few days and have had chapped lips that require repair.",1
Highly recommend !!! It works great especially after exfoliating my lips. I use it as a gloss during the day and smells great!,1
I received a sample of this lip mask with my order and OMG it got rid of the hyperpigmentation on my lips after only one use!,1
"I decided to give this lip treatment a try back in August 2022. First, I have been using it every night for the last 6mths and I have barely made a dent in it. Second, I usually use Blistex at night and throughout the day to keep my lips hydrated and protected from Canadian winters. Since using the sleep mask at night, I rarely have to use my Blistex. As far as bang for buck goes - I highly recommend! This is an excellent product.",1
"This has saved me during dry, cold, Canadian winters. I am prone to dry lips that could even crack when left untreated in the winter. This mask has helped keep my lips soft during the dry months of the year.",1
"Amazing, luxurious & yummy lip mask/treatment! Hands down the best lip treatment ever!",1
I use this every single night! I wake up with the softest lips ever!,1
"I LOVE this product! I use it every morning and night. It may be kind of expensive for a lip balm, but mine has lasted for over a year. I just wish they made it in a stick form so I didnâ€™t have to put my finger in it and it would be easier to use on the go.",1
"I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!! so hydrating, lasts super long. and generally a great product. BUY THIS!",1
I heard amazing things about this so I got it and it was amazing!,1
Using this every night has literally transformed my lips!  I no longer need constant hydration throughout the day. I just grab some of my fave lip balm as needed! Also gummy bear is the BEST smell!!,1
"I have never found a product that helps my lips like this. Iâ€™ve been using it for a year now and it is a LIFESAVER. I have tried so many other lip masks (including just plain Vaseline) and nothing compares. Highly highly recommend, lasts for a very long time too.",1
"Love this stuff, it has saved my lips. I wear it every night and my lips still feel soft in the morning.",1
This is a great nighttime and daytime balm. The smell is great and the balm is so hydrating without being sticky. My fave for treating chapped lips.,1
Absolutely love this line. I usually do the original or the gummy bear. I always wear this before bed and right before I walk out the door to start my day. Itâ€™s hydrating and I havenâ€™t found anything that is as comfortable and hydrating. Itâ€™s not sticky and the smell is lovely not too over powering,1
i first didnt understand the hype around this product when i tried it at the store but i decided to give it another chance and i really enjoy it now. you get a lot of product for the price and has an amazing sweet vanilla smell,1
great product! I put this on every night and wake up with hydrated lips,1
I love this product as Ã­t moisturizer my lips perfectly. I have áº£ really dry lips as well i have a problem in heat that my lips start swollen. But if i used it my lips donâ€™t dry out for almost 7-8 hours. So love it,1
"I literally love this lip mask! It smells so good, and it moisturizes my lips so well. For me, a must have!",1
I bought a mini version of this just to try and I regret it because i am ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE with this product and will now have to buy it all the time. Really recommend!!,1
I love this product! I have been using it every night for the past 5 years and I feel like it has made such a difference!,1
"I bought this lip mask almost a month ago and am already almost out because of how frequently Iâ€™ve been using it. My lips use to be crusty, now they look much healthier and feel smoother! Iâ€™ll be buying again!",1
"I received a sample with a previous order and gave this a try. Wow. I wasnâ€™t expecting much, but this has made a huge difference in my lips. I use it right before bed and itâ€™s like first aid for my skin. The smell is pleasant and a little goes a long way. I love the little silicone applicator that comes with it. Everything about this little baby puts it over the top. Love it and highly recommend.",1
I love these! This is my fourth flavor and I love it so much. It leaves my lips looking glossy in the day and hydrated in the night with a sheer pink tint. I love these lip masks!,1
has a very nostalgic smell that I love on top of being super thick & hydrating all throughout the night. also use this at the beginning of my makeup routine to ensure I have soft lips by the time I put on lipstick!,1
Love this product so much but the peppermint scent is the only good one. The other scents smell so fricken bad I couldnâ€™t believe it. The only bearable scent is the peppermint.,1
I received this product a few years back in the gift set and always repurchased it since. Itâ€™s very hydrating and a little goes a long way. I get really cracked lips during the winter and this lip mask really changed my complexion. I recommend using a lip applicator as the mask is very has a very sticky feel.,1
Great product & itâ€™s been an amazing overnight treatment,1
This product moisturizes your lips and keeps them soft. I think itâ€™s worth it to buy this.,1
This product is great for my lips. It is the only one that I could find that leaves my lips moist even through the night. I would recommend this product for people with dry and cracked lips.,1
"Ever since Iâ€™ve been off of accutane (which caused dey lips), I have had a habit of putting a lip balm or lip mask on my lips. I would normally say, â€œgo buy a lip balm its cheaperâ€œ but lip balms for me tend to dry out after a couple of hours, this one doesnâ€™t. My lips feel hydrated and refreshed all night. I got the vanilla one and it smells like warm sugar cookies. Itâ€™s $24 but itâ€™ll last you A LONG TIME because you donâ€™t need much at all. Best lip mask for me!",1
The only thing that has saved my lips during the winter. I always have to stick up on chapsticks and lip balms and this has keep my lips nice and smooth without all the peeling!,1
Even when the mask comes off my lips feel hydrated and I donâ€™t think it is overprice because of how big it is and because how popular it is (considering a lot of the viral sephora products are veeery expensive). Love it ðŸ’•,1
"Love! It is so hydrating. I apply it each night and morning, and it has changed my lips.",1
"10/10 ! Really Smooth  I love the texture ., the smell is okay .",1
"Super hydration, long lasting and very time I use it Weather itâ€™s at night or just during the day.",1
i love this lip mask! itâ€™s so hydrating and makes my lips feel so smooth. i have three different flavours and they all smell really nice. 10/10 recommend.,1
Love this product. I purchased this recently after having seen so many people rave about it and it was worth it! It makes your lips feel hydrated and keeps them moisturized. It is simply great!,1
"I purchased the bespoke-ish BTS set that did include Sweet Candy aside from the limited flavors. The most beautiful formula that melts instantly once applied to your lips; even the more gourmand flavors such as â€œButterâ€ eventually transform to a light berry aroma and why I mention this is at that stage is where the application truly sinks into your skin. When you wake up, you feel every fold in your lips is drawn forward, feeling more fuller and hydrated. Basically baby lips.",1
"After using this product for the last two weeks let me just say thisâ€¦ I brought another one. It applies so smoothly and lasts long and keeps my lips hydrated and moisturized, they got me for life.",1
"I personally love it. I put it on last after I do my skin care, right before bed. And I wake up and itâ€™s mostly all absorbed. I will be buying it again and again.",1
"Absolutely changed my lips, suffered from very cracked and dull texture/color. After using for a couple weeks now they are so healthy and vibrant, also use along side with their day lip balm!",1
I have very sensitive skin and this lip mask is so perfect and soothing. It has taken me almost a year to get through 3/4 of it. It stays on my lips all night too!,1
Love the way this makes my lips feel and look. Wear all the time day and night and my lips look and feel so soft.,1
"I love it, the flavour and the little applicator that comes with it is very good. I love that you donâ€™t need to much of it and the container lasts forever. The price is a bit high for my taste. But it does last a long time . But I do find that it doesnâ€™t hydrate the lips for a long time like in order to keep the lips hydrated you need to use it every night",1
"I will never stop raving about the lip sleeping mask! if I was on a desert island this is the one product I would bring with me, it makes my lips look sooooooo full (but natural) and I have naturally smaller lips. It genuinely made such a difference my friends were asking me what products I was using :) I usually put it on as the last step in my skin care routine morning and night (a thicker layer at night) and when I wake up in the mornings my lips just look amazing. THIS IS YOUR SIGN! IF YOUR QUESTIONING IT, BUY IT RIGHT NOW ITS A SERIOUS LIFE CHANGER",1
Best lip mask EVERRR! I have used it every single night for a few years and I always use it before I put makeup on. Itâ€™s extremely nourishing and hydrating. Love it.,1
"One of my favorite lip products.  It keeps my lips from getting dry at night during the winter.  I add several layers before I head to bed to make sure it stays on and I re-apply in the mornings and through-out the day, as needed.  This helps with chapped lips.",1
Its works like a miracle and gives soft and smooth lips,1
Le rÃ©sultat est instantanÃ© les lÃ¨vres sont repulpÃ© et hydratÃ©,1
I love this lip mask it hydrated my lips and makes them so soft. Since it is winter my lips get so chapped but ever since I used this they havenâ€™t been chapped.,1
100% worth it! Iâ€™ve been using this product for about 6 months and itâ€™s changed the game!! I use it before bed every night and I wake up with super hydrated lips. Iâ€™ve never woken up with lips this smooth.,1
I wear all day every chance I get. The high shine is soothing and sexy. A great product indeed,1
Best product I have used I love how it feels on! Not sticky at all. Makes my lips super soft and it so shiny and cute I wear it all day!,1
I love this lip mask ! Keeps my lips hydrated . Not sticky . I also love that it comes with a little applicator so you donâ€™t have to use your fingers.,1
The only lip product that really hydrates my lips during winter.,1
I absolutely love this stuff. I use it throughout the day and at nighttime before bed. Leaves my lips feeling hydrated and soft. Highly recommend.,1
"it works so well and has so much product, worth the price. only thing is the container itâ€™s in, it gets annoying from time to time how u have to use a small â€˜brushâ€™",1
"In just one night, this product has changed the way my lips feel.My lips feel really soft and moisturised. Definitely worth all the hype!",1
"This mask is the best for overnight lip care. I used to have cracked dry lips all winter but once I started using this almost every night my lips have been so healthy. My lips even stay hydrated the next day, I often donâ€™t even need to apply chapstick throughout the day. You also only need a tiny bit each night, so itâ€™s really worth the price!",1
"Is this product perfect? No. The jar isnâ€™t great for dipping into (I use the end of a skincare spatula to snag the teeniest bit), and I wish the feel were a little less tacky on. That being saidâ€”it does last a really long time, and for the price, especially given how little of it you need, itâ€™s worth every penny. I use it almost every night and frequently swipe on during the day when my lips need extra love.",1
"I currently have gummy bear, vanilla & the sweet candy scents! They smell AMAZING & feel very moisturizing + they give a glossy look which *I like* so keep that in mind.",1
Have this in two flavors and am obsessed! I am guilty of also wearing during the day! The color of this goes beautiful on top of a red lipstick,1
"The dry, cold winters in Alberta leave my lips so incredibly dry and nothing seemed to help. I use this nightly before bed and wake up every morning with hydrated, soft lips. Highly recommend !!",1
"Iâ€™ve been having chapped ever since I started using accutane from high school (mid 20s now and stopped using it). Until now I was using lip balm which was good but I ended up with semi-dried lips in the morning. But with this lip mask, my lips have been feeling healthy and hydrated, even a bit plump (the healthy plump). Its a pricy lip mask but you barely need a lot each night so this will last you a year a best.",1
"Throw away all of your carmex and other lip balms and get this, itâ€™s a life saver for dry lips! I was a chronic carmex user, constantly applying it all day and picking my lips, reapplying carmex, repeat. After using Laneige, my lips are moisturized and smooth, and I only need to apply it a couple of times a day. It doesnâ€™t sit on top of my lips like other chapsticks and I hardly pick my lips at all now. I highly recommend this for both day and night use, and especially if you have dry lips and nothing else works!",1
my holy grail lip mask & this one smells and tasted like sour gummy bears i love it. i use it every night & wake up with baby soft lips. i use it throughout the day as a lip balm too.,1
Very hydrating and smells amazing. I donâ€™t use it often as a mask than I do after makeup for a little color/hydration to the lips,1
"Pas de sens comme Ã§a sent bon!!! Mes lÃ¨vres sont douces, jâ€™ai habituellement les lÃ¨vres gercÃ©es en hiver mais ce produit aide beaucoup Ã  les hydrater. Vraiment contente!",1
I have used this for nearly a week and I absolutely love it! I cannot believe I waited so long. I think I was hung up on the â€œmaskâ€ part however it is just an amazing hydrating balm that smells great and does an even better job!,1
"Very hydrating! I use this as everyday lip balm and love it. Scent is amazing too. I have one in every room, bought them as gifts too! It can get a little soft and a little melty if the environment gets hot though (aka my woodstove heated environment) but still good!!",1
Love! So moisturizing and i feel so fancy while using it. It also kind of peels your lips in a good way and makes them soooo much softer,1
love all these masks. I own 4 now. And will buy again and again,1
"Iâ€™ve dealt with dry, chapped lips for years now and nothing has truly helped me until I came across this product! It has literally changed my life! BUT for me, itâ€™s ONLY the sweet candy flavor that actually works. My lips have never been softer!!! I tried the other ones and unfortunately they didnâ€™t work out for me (not sure why)",1
This stuff smells so good and I woke up with very soft lips and I also like using This on my lips for looks because it looks really nice! I recommend ðŸ’•ðŸ¬,1
"Iâ€™m really impressed with this lip mask. I only have a trial size that came in a package of other items, but this small size is going to last awhile! You need only the tiniest amount. It has a nice scent but no weird taste. It also stays really well on the lips. I applied it before bed and always drink water leading up to going to bed and right before I go to sleep and it didnâ€™t come off. My house has a wood stove so it is extra dry in the winter and this mask has been great for keeping my lips moisturized.",1
"This lip mask is hydrating, nourishing, and it also has simple fancy packaging! The smell is so good I literally want to eat it. Def recommend. If you have cracked dry lips and use at night, youâ€™ll wake up with smooth lips!",1
Lâ™¥ï¸VE this lip mask! Hydrates and leaves my lips feeling so soft. And the scent is fabulous!,1
I love this product and it makes my lips feel amazing!!! My personal favorite is the gummy bear,1
"insane product! so hydrating, is use it every morning and night",1
She is my girl yâ€™all she works so good and she feels so nice. When I tell you how many I apply her in a day is wow. She did her thing I love laneige ðŸ˜ðŸ’…ðŸ½,1
"Prior to using this product, winter was incredibly harsh on my lips, especially this year. They were cracked and bleeding frequently and no matter what I did, nothing was working, which is the reason why I bought this product (after consulting with a sale associate at the store). The product only says it will hydrate your lips and make them soft and smooth, nothing more, but after one use, my bleeding and cracked lips were almost completely healed! They were definitely hydrated and my lips stop cracking since I started to use the product. The second night of using this product, my lips looked way better than they have in years and honestly, I continue to use this product for the winter as I do not want to go back to damaged lips. The product is easy to use, it smells nice, which is always a bonus, and does an incredible job at keeping my lips hydrated and looking AMAZING. Definitely worth the price of the product and it lasts for quite some time.",1
"I was in a rush for an important event and needed a specific lipstick shade from Sephora. I opted for their same-day delivery service, and I was blown away. The makeup arrived within hours, and it was exactly what I needed. Sephora's commitment to customer satisfaction is unmatched",1
Keeps my lips not dry or cracked for days and it smells so good!,1
This mask makes me hate using anything else on my lips! It absorbs so well and is just the right amount of glossyâ€” I wear it before bed every night but also as a balm anytime. The vanilla one smells just like vanilla taffy!,1
I use this every single night! The first time I used it I had severe cracked lips that nothing could heal. One application and I was healed! I love this lip mask!,1
I love this Laneige Lip Mask! It makes my lips look and feel so hydrated! 100% recommend!,1
I was recommended this product by a friend. I decided to give it a try and I will never go back. It leaves your lips so moisturized. My 5 year old daughter also gets VERY chapped lips and this has truly done wonders for her. she now has her own and uses it every single night !,1
smells so amazing and it feels wonderful on my lips. Its so cute and def worth the hype,1
This makes my lips feel so soft and feminine.  Makes me feel like I have my life together.,1
I really canâ€™t say enough about this product! And I NEVER review products but this was too good. My lips feel incredibly hydrated and itâ€™s nice because the formula isnâ€™t sticky. It feels like butter on your lips! I got the vanilla and itâ€™s soooo GOOD! 10/10 recommend!,1
"I was gifted this and now must have it all the time. Itâ€™s the last step of my nighttime skincare, and I wake up with soft, hydrated lips every day.",1
"after only a few uses my lips have stayed moisturized throughout the whole day, and my lips are no longer cracked.",1
my lips used to be so chapped i couldnâ€™t wear gloss or anything. all i could wear was aquaphor or my lips could crack and bleed. this mask i wore 2 times and i donâ€™t need anything on my lips at all. worth the money 110%!!,1
"I love using this at any time of day. It smells good, is hydrating, glossy, and will be a forever repurchase! I love the variety of flavors too!",1
"iâ€™ve been using this for only 2 days and my lips already feel amazing. super easy application too, i love that it comes with an applicator. i will be buying the other flavours asap",1
Allergies = having dry & cracked lipsâ€¦ Iâ€™ve been using this product for less than a week and to be entirely honest I wasnâ€™t sure at first but after 5 days my lips feel more hydrated. Happy w purchase!,1
"I love it so much, it smells so good, its the best ever. its more gooey than creamy, kind of lipglossy. 10/10, exept for previous brand decisios",1
"Sephora's Flash Shipping is a game-changer! I signed up for it, and now I can get my makeup deliveries in just two days. It's incredibly convenient, especially when I need a last-minute touch-up for an event. The products always arrive in perfect condition, and the packaging is top-notch. Well worth the subscription fee!",1
"this is a must have, and it smells amazing!! definitely recommend",1
Actually helps keep my lips moisturized. I havent had an overnight product that stays on and helps before.,1
"Love! Original and Sweet Candy smell best, unless you get the Peppermint thatâ€™s seasonal. A little dab will do so it lasts a long time. I use it in the evening after taking off makeup or any time Iâ€™m extra dry.",1
"I recently placed an order for some makeup products from Sephora, and I couldn't be happier with the delivery experience. The package arrived exactly on the estimated date, and everything was securely packaged. Sephora's attention to detail and care for their products is evident. I'm already planning my next order!",1
THE BEST! Anytime my lips feel dry this brings them back to life. Itâ€™s not sticky like a lip gloss would be either so you can really wear it whenever youâ€™d like.,1
I have been using this product for over 2 weeks.  I found that this product was helpful during the Winter months where my lips are dried out.,1
really hydrating and so good i love it so much i use it every night,1
I absolutely LOVE this lip mask. My lips remain hydrated for long. Bye bye chapped lips!!,1
"I have the mango one but since itâ€™s discontinued now (ðŸ˜­) I had to just pick another flavor to write a review; I got it for Xmas and have been using it for just over a month now & I love it!! Iâ€™d been so excited to try this product for forever but tried to go into it with low expectations since some people said it was overhyped and didnâ€™t really do anything, personally I think itâ€™s incredible ðŸ¥°the scent is amazing & since I started using it every night I seriously have not had chapped or dry lips once! I used to have to put on an insane amount of chapstick in the morning and reapply several times throughout the day (havenâ€™t used chapstick at all since I got this) and I love that just wearing a lip mask while Iâ€™m asleep keeps my lips hydrated literally 24/7",1
"I love this product. Itâ€™s been a staple of mine ever since Iâ€™ve started shopping at Sephora. It smells sweet and a bit artificial, but it moisturizes my lips so well! It does leave a sticky feeling on your lips, but if youâ€™re putting it on to sleep, itâ€™s negligible. I love the fact that it comes with an applicator. Be careful not to put the sleeping mask on the outside of your lips because it does seem to clog the pores around your mouth.",1
i will always have this on my bedside table. havent had cracked or bleeding lips in years because of this,1
"Yes, it is every bit as good as everyone says it is. A wonderful, luxurious, treat to apply before bed and wake up with soft lips. Have been using it for years and is a staple product.",1
"I came across this via social media. I have recently started to take better care of my skin and wear makeup, so I thought why not. I love it. It feels so good, and when I wake up the next morning, I can tell a big difference. If I stop using it for a handful of nights, my lips feel noticeably drier. I want more!",1
"I love this product it makes your lips for really soft, first i didnâ€™t understand what all the hype was about on this but now I know i canâ€™t go a day without using this.",1
"I use it daily, share it with my partner and it still lasts such a long time. One of our favorite products everrrrrr.",1
"This has been the besssst product I have ever purchased!!! It doesnâ€™t say itâ€™s to plump your lips but let me tell all you girlies, this stuff makes my lippys super luscious and plump!!",1
I am absolutely in love with the laneige lip masks. I bought a mini one is the sweet dream duo set and itâ€™s lasted me for over a year using it anytime I could. I just had to buy the full size. itâ€™s hydrating and has such a nice subtle fruity scent which isnâ€™t overpowering. Definitely a staple in my nighttime routine.,1
"I absolutely love this product! Iâ€™ve always used a chapstick or lip balm on my lips before bed. I received a sample of this and loved it so much, I ordered the full-sized product. With previous products, I could feel any residual product remaining on my lips the next morning and most often, my lips would feel dry again in the morning. Not with the Laniege Lip Sleeping Mask! It is fantastic! Iâ€™ve only been using it for a few weeks, but Iâ€™m hoping with continued use, the tiny lines along the edges of my lips will diminish.",1
This is the second time Iâ€™ve repurchased this lip mask.  The first time i got the original berry and this time I tried the gummy bear one.  Itâ€™s a little grape-y and I LOVE it.  One container lasts forever and is the only thing that keeps my lips moisturized overnight.  I apply a generous layer before bed and itâ€™s still there on my lips by the next morning.,1
My lips have never felt healthier. The difference even after a couple of days was crazy!,1
Jâ€™adore ce produit. Avant de lâ€™utiliser mes lÃ¨vres Ã©tait toujours sec et Ã§a fait maintenant depuis quelque semaine que je lâ€™utilise et mes lÃ¨vres nâ€™ont jamais Ã©tÃ© aussi douce.Je le recommande !,1
Love this! Even gave some to my boyfriend since he works outside and healed his lips after using this two times. The more you use it the better and softer your lips get IMO,1
"This lip sleeping mask is not just moisturizing it also tastes sweet! Itâ€™s good for dry, chapped lips!",1
"This leaves my lips very soft and moisturized. The vanilla scent is also very nice- not too subtle, not too strong. I personally love using this after my nighttime skincare or after my makeup routine. Iâ€™ll use Glossierâ€™s Gen G lipstick in â€œCakeâ€œ and then put this on top. It has a very glossy finish. Overall, itâ€™s very good and comes in a pretty big container. Unless you only use this or use lip balm a lot it should last you awhile.",1
"I love this product so much. I ended up buying the lip balm tubes for every day when I go out - I was originally just looking for a lip-sleeping mask. The only â€œnegativeâ€œ thing I would say is that I donâ€™t like the way youâ€™re supposed to apply it. I would much rather buy it in a tube. However, my lips still have the product on when I wake up and my lips always feel moisturized in the mornings.",1
So smooth. It smells really good. It lasts a long time.,1
"Now that I started using this and completely emptied my first pot, I canâ€™t go back to vaseline/aquafor! For me personally, those DO NOT work the same as this mask. Sure my lips never got chapped really with aquafor/vaseline every night, but I truly notice a difference with this mask. My lips feel plumper and smoother by far. And all over too, I would always have slightttt dryness closer to the inside of my mouth but this completely takes that away. I always still feel a slight stickiness in the morning. Iâ€™ve decided I am going to buy a backup to have in my bag at all times because its great for daytime natural looks too. Iâ€™ll never go back to regular chapstick again (burts bees), the difference is night and day.",1
"I really love this product. Itâ€™s one of my go to lip masks as I prep for bed. No matter what my lips look like at night, in the morning they are always fully moisturized and bouncy. It really gets deep in there to hydrate and heal my lips overnight.",1
Best you can get for you dry lips or just for to keep them soft â¤ï¸,1
I have problems with dry lips and I have noticed more hydration on my lips these past couple of months. Iâ€™m not turning to my chapstick as often these days.,1
Great overnight treatment. Lips feel soft and moisturized next morning. I also use as lip balm before I leave for work,1
"I bought this product yesterday and loved it! Itâ€™s super smooth and hydrating, and has a nice scent!",1
"I donâ€™t want to love this for some reason, but it really does hydrate the best. Looks cute as a gloss too for low maintenance girlies!! Iâ€™d say this, burtâ€™s bees lip sleeping treatment, and dr dennis gross lip cushion are the only three chapsticks that work - and thatâ€™s on god",1
"I like this lip mask best compared to other brands I have tried. This actually will heal you lips over night. Great for the morning too. Must buy for cracked, peeling, or dry lips.",1
I promise you that you canâ€™t find annnyyyything in this world bettter than this lip mask.â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸,1
I have been using this for the past 2 week and basically what it does it dries of the dead skin on your lips so when you exfoliate your lips you get a really soft lips that stay soft! I ordered the lip mask and the glossðŸ˜ðŸ˜,1
i love this so much! my lips can get very dry and eventually start bleeding! i bought this a while back and only just started using it. iâ€™ve really been hoping to buy another one but iâ€™m not 100% sure.,1
"I love this . Itâ€™s been a staple for about 4 years now. super nourishing. last a long time Iâ€™d say for me around 10 months, I have one always by my nightstand and one in my living room coffee table. I see some people saying you can get cheaper chapstick for less, itâ€™ doesnâ€™t compare at all. First, this stays and applies beautifully as you sleep, hence the name. doesnâ€™t break me out around my mouth like other have before. you wakeup with beautiful plump lips. also this feels so much better thn a lip balm. I love vanilia and the orignal now Iâ€™m on my summer one thatâ€™s mango and as I apply before I go to sleep feels like on the beach. deff receccomnd",1
"Iâ€™m in Colorado and am outside a lot. My lips were constantly dry and Iâ€™ve tried every brand of ChapStick and lip balm there is (Carmex, Burtâ€™s, etc...) but this has been the BEST product I have ever tried. Iâ€™ve had cracking lips that would peel always making me feel bad going anywhere. I legit had bleeding lips everyday. I slather on a layer before going to bed and when I wake up, my lips are SMOOTH! This is a first for me! I do follow-up throughout the day with the lip balm as well. Not sure how this works with any lipstick as I do not wear it. I also dd not see any lip plumping but wasnâ€™t looking for that anyways.",1
I love this product so much it lasts a while and thereâ€™s a lot of product that comes with it itâ€™s really worth the money,1
Love this product! Leaves my lips so soft and the effect lasts for days. Its a part of my regular nightly routine.,1
"Perfect for dry lips, i suffer from extreme chapped lips and they are perfff for it",1
This made my lips so hydrated and juicy they looked so hydrated  recommended.,1
Smells amazing like a strawberry banana smoothie and so thick and moisturizing itâ€™s amazing for any time of day,1
"i honestly love this sleeping mask so much, i put it on every night before i go to bed and my lips are always so hydrated in the morning, yes itâ€™s a little pricey but it lasts awhile.",1
I absolutely love the LANEIGE lip sleeping masks but the peppermint scent is one of my new favourite.,1
Iâ€™ve repurchased this lip mask more times than I can count. Itâ€™s the only lip product that actually repairs my dry cracked lips.,1
"Iâ€™ve bought this product multiple times now and just simply adore it. Itâ€™s hydrating, light weight, and isnâ€™t sticky. It lasts a long time and a little goes a long way.",1
ten out of ten.  it keeps my lips so hydrated all day at school and gives me such a pretty gloss + it smells SO GOOODDD. absolute favourite!,1
"The best lip mask I have found--it is the ONLY one Iâ€™ve used that fully heals chapped & peeling lips from midwestern winter + tretinoin flakiness within only a few days. It also lasts forever, since itâ€™s thick and a little goes a long way, and it smells amazing.",1
I love this! Itâ€™s a must for anyone! Itâ€™s the only thing that fixes my dry chapped lips in the winter! and the smell is absolutely amazing. I definitely recommend,1
"First off, I am definitely one of those people that are addicted to chapstick, so this is a game changer. This feels so good on your lips - thick but not sticky. Bonus - it looks pretty on too!",1
Iâ€™ve been using the lip sleeping mask for almost a year now and I cannot rave enough about how much I love it. It leaves my lips feeling so moisturized and soft. I use it before bed but through the day as well. I like this scent however the purple one smells so much better. I will definitely be trying other scents :),1
"i have the berry and vanilla! they are both super awesome, leave your lips feeling super hydrated and smooth in the morning, itâ€™s one of my favourite products of my nighttime routine! especially in the winter!",1
I compulsively pick the skin off my lips when I get stressed out (yes gross) and this helped them return to some semblance of normal almost immediately. The texture and smell/taste are amazing too.,1
Soo hydrating. I kid you not my lips were cracked in half from the cold winter air before I started using this product. Smells good and works well,1
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. itâ€™s become part of my nightly skincare routine.,1
I love it so muchhh!! My lips get hydrated instantly and I always keep this in my bag 24/7,1
"I have noticed a large improvement in my lip texture. There is a lot more time in between reapplication and much less dry. Comparable to the Tatcha mask, but better value.",1
"Really nice, thick texture that isnâ€™t sticky. I put on a generous layer before going to bed and there is a little bit remaining in the morning. The scent is very delicate, not too powerful, which is good!  Very moisturizing too!",1
"During canadian winter, this product is the best iâ€™ve used. My lips are totally Â«restoredÂ» in the morning! A little bit is just enough!",1
love it sooo much !! i havent tried many lip masks but this one would definitely be one of my favorites. its sooo hydrating and ill wake up with soft lips. lasts all night and i love that it comes with a small soft silicone â€˜spatulaâ€™.,1
"The Hourglass Ambient Lighting Palette comes in a sleek, reflective case that exudes luxury. The palette is also surprisingly compact for containing three large pans. The secure clasp ensures it won't accidentally open in your bag. It's a perfect example of form meeting function.",1
"I got this as a Christmas gift, smells amazing and very moisturizing and hydrating! Definitely recommend!!",1
"As someone with chronically dry lips, I can say this is definitely worth the hype! I started using this instead of Vaseline on my lips every night, and Iâ€™ve noticed a significant change! I used get painfully dry lips a couple of times a month, but I havenâ€™t had an incident since using this product",1
Provided much needed and surprising TLC after my 2nd pregnancy. Instant hydration noticed and helped with the darkness from dehydration. Definitely recommend,1
No because this works so good. It makes your lips feel sooo soft. I wear this during the day as well. I pair it with Mac lip liner and it looks so bomb! Going to try the sweet candy flavor !!,1
"So good! The scents are yummy and moisturizes my extremely dry lips. I use it every night before I go to sleep. The consistency is the perfect balance of doesnâ€™t disappear immediately and soaks into your lips. Again, every scent is so good.",1
"I just got this product and I loveee it! I have excessively chapped lips and tried this in the store, had to get it immediately online as it was sold out. I love the way my lips feel already",1
"Glossier's Cloud Paint packaging is minimalistic and adorable. The small, paint tube design is not only cute but also incredibly practical. It's easy to squeeze out just the right amount of product, and the twist-off cap ensures no mess. Plus, the soft pink color matches the product inside.",1
Ive been needing something other than my Cerave healing ointment for my chapped lips and this is a 10/10! I have extremely sensitive skin & it passes the test!,1
The smell is amazing and leaves lips so soft and hydrates. Totally recommend!,1
"I use this product every night and love the way it makes my lips feel, especially in the cold months here in the midwest",1
Love the scent and how moisturizing it is. I bought this product for while Iâ€™m on Accutane as your lips become severely dry. This really helps prevent my lips from cracking!,1
"Absolutely love this product, iâ€™ve been using it for 2 years and always makes my lips feel moisturized and hydrated in the morning. best purchase ever!!!!",1
Love wearing this at night. I live in a dry climate so it takes a lot to keep my skin and lips moisturized. For me it works best if I wear a lip balm and then put this mask over it. It is super glossy but I like that!,1
"I saw all the hype about this so I wanted to try it. In my opinion the Sweet Candy one smells the best. the little stick it comes with is helpful, but I tend to apply it with my finger instead.The texture reminds me of vaseline in the container, but lip gloss on your lips.",1
"This is the real deal!  Wake up with super soft and HEALED lips.  Aquaphor and Vaseline donâ€™t absorb like this does.  This little jar lasts forever.  In fact, the flavor that I actually purchased is â€œpeachâ€œ, from this past spring/summer if that gives you an idea of how long this lasts!",1
"Too Faced hit the mark with the packaging of their Better Than Sex Mascara. The pink, hourglass-shaped tube is not only eye-catching but also comfortable to hold. The hourglass brush inside perfectly coats every lash. It's a standout in my makeup collectio",1
Love this lip mask nothing else will do Aquaphor and Vaseline just arenâ€™t as moisturizing as this mask is I recommend it to everyone I knowï¿¼,1
"Every time I receive a package from Sephora, it's like unwrapping a gift. The attention to detail in their packaging is incredible. The products are always carefully cushioned, and I've never had anything arrive damaged. It's clear that Sephora values the customer's experience from the moment they place an order",1
"I had an issue with a recent makeup delivery, and I contacted Sephora's customer service. They were incredibly responsive and went above and beyond to rectify the situation. They re-sent my order, and it arrived even faster than the first time. I'm so impressed with their commitment to customer satisfaction. Sephora has won me over as a loyal customer",1
I was disappointed with the packaging of my recent Sephora order. The eyeshadow palette arrived with a cracked mirror and one of the shades had shattered. The packaging should have provided better protection for the product.,0
"The lip gloss itself is great, but the packaging was subpar. The cap came loose during shipping, causing some leakage. I expected better quality control from a brand like Fenty Beauty.",0
"The concealer tube arrived with a faulty pump, making it difficult to dispense the product. It's frustrating to receive a defective item, especially from a high-end brand like NARS.",0
"While the eyeshadow quality is amazing, the packaging leaves much to be desired. The gold case looks luxurious but feels flimsy. Mine arrived with a dent, which was disappointing for such a pricey palette.",0
"The foundation bottle arrived with a cracked pump, causing a mess during my first use. It's frustrating when the packaging fails to protect the product.",0
"The lip liner pencil in my kit arrived broken. The packaging should have provided better cushioning for delicate items like this. It was a letdown, especially for a product at this price point",0
The mirror inside my palette was scratched when it arrived. I expected better quality control for a product of this caliber. It's disappointing to receive a damaged item.,0
"The tube of cloud paint arrived partially open, and some product had leaked out. It was a mess to clean up, and I felt like I lost a significant portion of what I paid for.",0
"The mascara tube arrived with a loose cap, which caused the product to dry out faster than usual. It's frustrating to receive a product that doesn't meet the expected quality standards.",0
"I bought this lip mask after reading the reviews and the hype. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations as vaseline petroleum jelly works way better for me.",0
Honestly I was so excited when I got this in the mail. But unfortunately it is not worth the hype :( I have boughten two of these full size and I went through them so quickly. The ingredients are not very clean and this product made my lips so dry. I wanted to like this product so bad as itâ€™s so cute and smells nice. But unfortunately it is a hard pass for me. I will be sticking to my vaseline and aquaphor for now :/,0
Just like  Aquaphor just get something cheaper itâ€™s just overrated. Itâ€™s good but they also animal test. ï¿¼,0
i really tried to love this â˜¹ï¸ i wore it to sleep every night for a month but every time i woke up with lips chapped and peeling.overhyped and not worth the money- just use vasaline,0
"dried my lips out sooooooo bad. literally were cracked, peeling, and bleeding. I stopped using it and it got better. def do not recommend buying this",0
"I used this product daily last week, and my lips hurt. I stopped using it and just used Aquaphor to heal them, and they are doing much better. I might be allergic to this product.",0
I used to like this product until I found out it has BHT in it which is HAZARDOUS. Please do your research on the ingredients and youâ€™ll see this is horrible for you and your body especially if ingested.,0
Didnâ€™t enjoy this product. I got it as a birthday gift. Iâ€™ve only used it twice. Both times it dried out my lips badly that it took a week to get better. It left my lips more chapped than I began with was,0
"This product smells good but that is basically the only good thing. The lip mask feels like a weird bubble gum and looks identical to Vaseline when on your lips. Maybe if this product wasnâ€™t thirty dollars dollarsit would be worth it, but since itâ€™s not I do not recommend it would be worth",0
This feels and smells nice but over time it dried my lips out more than any other lip balm/mask Iâ€™ve ever put on my lips. My lips were literally peeling after using this for a few weeks and Iâ€™ve never had that happen to me before,0
This is awful and feel bad my daughter bought me this for Xmas. It does not moisturize my lips at all. Wish I could get a refund since she wasted her own money on this.,0
love the initial application because it layers so well on your lips and feels hydrated. But after 2 uses it began making my lips feel all chapped. Better off with vaseline,0
I wanted to love it. Made my lips worse no matter what I did. Not worth it honestly. Only positive is it smells nice,0
I tried this twice and I broke out in sores the morning after both times. Literally thrown in the trash.,0
I would give zero stars if I could just because they TEST on ANIMALS! But I got this as a sample in a hydration kit I purchased and it really isnâ€™t worth the hype. Didnâ€™t really make any difference for me. Maybe it made my lips a tiny bit softer in the morning but nothing huge that lip balm cant do. Not worth the price of fullsize and I wouldnâ€™t purchase,0
"On application the mask takes forever to absorb and leaves my lips feeling greasy and sticky, hence why itâ€™s a sleeping mask I suppose; though I could see it just ending up all over your bedding. But thatâ€™s not my biggest issue with it. Itâ€™s that it doesnâ€™t work. It leaves my lips dry and cracked. Iâ€™ve ended up with multiple free samples of it that Iâ€™d rather just throw out and use a product that actually works instead.",0
"This really didnâ€™t work for me. At all. It was somehow worse than using nothing. Every morning I would wake up with dry, crispy, flaking lips. $2 balm from the gas station gives me better results",0
terrible product. they made my lips extremely chapped for a week and my skin was dry and peeling. do not buy,0
"Horrible!! I used this product THREE times and it DRIED my lips out and im still healing from it! Iâ€™m using aquaphor, chapstick, vaseline to heal it but still hasnt fully gone back to my normal lips. Thworst purchase ive ever made",0
"Not worth the hype for the product. Not only did it not hydrate my lips, I felt the need to keep reapplying to get some sort of relief. The fact that they test on animals is a bit NO for me. Will not purchase this brand again.",0
It made my lips more dry and they felt horrible. It is not the worst out there but definitely not worth the price.I do love the smell.,0
This broke me out around my mouth REALLY bad. I had to discontinue use.,0
Bro I got the pumpkin one and itâ€™s soooo drying it feels like you havenâ€™t drank water in a month I donâ€™t recommend i think the berry one is the only good one but Iâ€™ve only tried that once so i donâ€™t knowï¿¼.,0
Nope nope nope. Used for the past month or so and realized dry patches on side of my lips and my lips literally are never not dry and cracked. My lips were fine before this so I came look at the review and saw one mention something called  angular  cheilitis and looked  it ul and thats definitely one of the things that was caused by this. goinng ti stop using and Im sure my lips will be back to normal now that Ive finally figured out what was the cause,0
"I find it makes your lips dependant on the product. I used it daily, and as soon as I stopped my lips cracked so badly they split and bled when I spoke. I have never had drier lips in my entire life.",0
Honestly I used it once and it made my lips look amazing but I hate that I didnâ€™t read anything about it. I hate using a product that rests on animals so I hate that I wasted my money since I wonâ€™t be using ðŸ˜‚,0
"I was really excited to try this product after so many fav reviews. Unfortunately, the only thing this did to my lips was make them more chapped and dry.",0
"I absolutely loved this product and was about to reorder, but was reading reviews to see if I went with different flavor than the original, and was surprised to find out that they test on animals.  Definitely will NOT be buying again.  Shame on them!",0
Laneige is not cruelty free! They do test on animals!,0
"WASTE OF MONEY. Use vaseline, cerave healing ointment or lanolips ointment 101. This is so hyped, overpriced and under delivering. Made my lips pale and wasnt hydrating as vaseline. Nthanks.",0
"Good product, but LANEIGE tests on animals. Not cruelty-free. Get it together, LANEIGE. Hope this posts.",0
"after using this product for 3 weeks, my lips have never been more dry and crusty. my lips were amazing before but now they are horrible. They also test on animals which is a no no and they over price their products so much. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!thoverprice alla",0
"Caused angular cheilitis (cracking on inner corners of lips) three times i have used. Yes the rest of my lips have been moisturized, but the product collects in inner corners causing cracks- very uncomfortable",0
"This product sucks. The only redeeming thing is the application and the packaging. This is like putting water on my lips, it did absolutely nothing. So much hype for nothing and not to mention ani",0
It smells nice but thatâ€™s about it.  I also donâ€™t understand the hype behind this lip mask.  I found it sticky and it made no difference on my lips.,0
This didnâ€™t work for me. I used as directed and would wake up in the morning with dry lips. Iâ€™m confused by all of the â€œgreat reviews.â€  I do not recommend.,0
"Unpopular opinion, but I donâ€™t like this product. I bought it twice now influenced by reviews but my main complaint is that it is so sticky on my lips, I just canâ€™t stand it and want to wipe it off as soon as I put it on. Plus Iâ€™m always thinking if it would stain my silk pillow case.",0
"Drying! Iâ€™ve never had a more drying lip mask than this one. I thew this product away. Also, they test on animals.",0
"for the price this honestly isnâ€™t that great of a product. my lips turn dry just as quickly as using $2 chapstick, and feel just as hydrated after use. not sure where all the hype of this came because itâ€™s pretty subpar. iâ€™d rather use walgreens bought chapstick.",0
Dried my lips out even more than they already were.,0
"This product smells and feels good when applied. Unfortunately, thatâ€™s where the compliments end. ðŸ’€This thing dried my lips out so bad and I realized that my lips were giving sandpaper so long as I treated them with more mask. When I finally switched back to some basic EOS balm, my lips magically came back to life. I tried using the mask again to make sure I wasnâ€™t tripping, and they went right back to being dry. Low-key it feels like Laneige created a problem that makes you need to buy more product to treat, but it could also just be incompatible with some people. ðŸ¤·ðŸ¾â€â™€ï¸",0
So i used to love this product until i found out itâ€™s not vegan or cruelty freeâ€¦ Come on now,0
"I tried the gummy bear scent, to me its not any better then the cheaper products, i wonâ€™t buy again, was hoping i would like it, i do like the scent though.",0
Dries out my lips during the day. Had to stop using because it led to broken and chapped lips!,0
"At the age of 36, Iâ€™ve tried many lip balm/glosses, from childhood lip smacker to Tom Ford. This stuff reminds me of that really thick Vaseline like balm the body shop sold mid 90â€™s. Anyways, this stuff is garbage. I live in norther Canada abd itâ€™s really dry! I had a crack on my lip for over a week I was trying to heal with this mask, and nothing would give. 2 days out now with $5 lip medic and my crack is almost healed. This is now retired to my 9 year olds collection of make up I wasted money on. .",0
"This is the second lip sleeping mask Iâ€™ve tried. The first was from PCA Skin. This one got very enthusiastic reviews so I thought Iâ€™d try it. Itâ€™s no better. If anything, my lips look drier in the morning after using it. They donâ€™t improve lip dryness better than Burtâ€™s Bees lip balm. Maybe it works better on young lips? I donâ€™t recommend it for older women.",0
"This product has been blowing up so I purchased because my lips get dry this time of season. I was NOT impressed. I put in on before bed and when I woke up my lips still felt the mask on them so I was impressed with that. By around 10am, my lips felt more dry than the previous night. This prduct only feels nice when in use. Good alternative is the vaseline lip therapy. Leaves my lips nice all day, costs way less, last way longer. Stay safe.",0
"This was no better than any drugstore lip balm. It helped for first few minutes of it being on, but after that it did nothing for my dry lips. Returning",0
This made my lips more dry for some reason. Vaseline worked better for me.,0
super cute packaging but it literally gave me a rash and burns on my lips,0
All of these scents smell like chemicals and cheap candles. Wonâ€™t ever buy.,0
I regret buying this ðŸ˜­ does not help my lips at all. They feel chapped all the time and all this does is makes my lips feel soft. I feel like I have to keep reapplying. People over hype this product up. Try the Jack Black lip balm you wonâ€™t regret it and it has SPF :),0
"Really not worth the hype or the price. Feels just like ï¿¼vaseline, and not even that hydrating.",0
"This is the worst! It might work for others and truly I was influenced seeing it all over TikTok but it dried out my lips so bad, worse than they already were. I do have sensitive skin and live in a dry climate but this is my first ever return since being a customer in 2005. One pro is the scents are great ðŸ‘ðŸ»",0
"I rarely write reviews, but felt I had to after recently learning that Laneige tests on animals. I have bought a few jars and admit the product is pretty good. But not good enough for me to continue giving money to a company that abuses animals. There are other lip masks I have used that are just as good as Laneige, so itâ€™s not really something Iâ€™ll have a hard time replacing in my skincare routine. Itâ€™s a shame this brand has been promoted so much and not many know about its animal testing. But hopefully reading reviews like this can spread awareness and encourage others who care about animal cruelty to look elsewhere!",0
Iâ€™m sure this works for some folks but honestly itâ€™s not worth the price. My lips were dry again within an hour. Please save your money and get the vaseline lip therapy for a fraction of the price. You can get the same amount for $6 and itâ€™s more effective.,0
Itâ€™s great at first and I used to love it! But it started drying out my lips and I would wake up to them being so flaky. I asked my friends who also used this product and the same thing eventually happened to them too.,0
"After using this nightly (and no other lip products), my lips were actually worseâ€” in fact they were so dry they split. I stopped using this product and my lips have improved. Sorry to say I fell for the hype, although it does smell wonderful.",0
"An overall non-functional and cheap product. First of all, this product pales in comparison to Vaseline when you leave it overnight and it also smells and feels a lot like Victoriaâ€™s Secrets older lip glosses that came in a tube. Secondly, the packaging of this lip balm is absolutely stupid. I hate dipping my fingers in this little jar especially when I have long nails or I am out and about or Iâ€™ve already forgotten that Iâ€™ve put on hand sanitizer or lotion. The applicator itself is ridiculous as well. Itâ€™s about 2 in long and there is nowhere to put it. I feel like both products are extremely unsanitary. Lastly, the price ridiculous. like I mentioned Vaseline does a way better job and itâ€™s so much cheaper if youâ€™re serious about moisturizing your lips. Not worth it.",0
"This product did not work at all for me. After trying repeatedly over many nights I saw no difference in hydration. Honestly, I have better results using cheap lipbalm to help with the dryness of my lips.",0
"I tried out this product after all the hype on it helping with dried lips.. As soon as I looked at the ingredients and couldnâ€™t believe what was in it.. many ingredients banned in other countries, including Red Lake etc... I tried the product, and it dried them out. Exactly what I thought would happen.As a skin care professional, itâ€™s sad to see so many influencers give positive reviews for compensation and free products rather than genuine experiences, product info, and results.This product might work for some people who donâ€™t care for ingredients, but there are many companies using better, cleaner, healthier, non toxic ingredients for their lip balms.Everything we put on our lips gets ingested into our bodies, itâ€™s important to know the ingredients.",0
The only good thing about this balm is the scent and how it feels on the lips. I found out that this is what was destroying my lips. I had full flakes lifting from my lips and a layer of crust. I used my Burts beeâ€™s and it healed my lips. I went back to this and got the crusty lips. I just donâ€™t get the hype.,0
"I noticed my daughter had this product in her drawer. Throw it out immediately. Wish I could rave about this product, itâ€™s not a clean product. Ingredients are not the best for ones body.",0
"I think I had bought into the hype of this product just because I did see many people on social media talking about it. However, with what initially I thought was a fine product after using this for a few weeks I noticed some things. I would wake up with dehydrated lips. If anything the more I was using this the more I noticed I would wake up with almost chapped lips. My only other gripe is the price and size. I havenâ€™t brought myself to finish this lip mask and I probably wonâ€™t. Iâ€™ve returned to using Vaseline/aquaphor which is way cheaper and actually worksâ€¦",0
"I started using this product and within about a week my mental health plummeted to being absolutely terrible, I didnâ€™t think much of it, just assuming that I was having a stressful time and was depressed so I didnâ€™t see a link to this lip mask, but when I stopped using it all my stress and depression went away, but I also went through the worst most painful dry and cracked lips of my life from withdrawal from it that started a day after quitting, so the benefits werenâ€™t even worth it because you are basically committing to it daily for life.  Shea butter works better than this.",0
Horrible!  Chapped my lips to the point where Iâ€™m peeling cracked skin and bleeding!!  Going back to my Fresh Sugarâ€¦never shouldâ€™ve strayed.,0
Good mask dont get me wrong! But the fact its 2022 almost 2023 and they are still animal testing doesnt sit right with me. I was unaware that they tested on animals when i bought this and now that it has come to my attention i will not be repurchasing,0
"I had heard the raves about this sleeping mask and I was excited about it, but this is one of the most horrible smelling products I have ever seen. It smells nothing like â€œsweet candyâ€œ but more like some sort of industrial plastic. Just awful. I wouldnâ€™t want it anywhere near my mouth. This is going back for sure.",0
"I tries these lip masks because of all the positive reviews but unfortunately, I did not like them. They have the same feel and texture as putting vaseline on your lips and if that is what you want Vaseline costs much less. I wish they were just a better quality for the price.",0
They still test on animals :( Both laneige and their parent company test on animals,0
"This product is not good. After so many influencers and celebrities were recommending it, I decided to try it out. Its effect is nil, and when I checked the ingredients list, it is full of synthetic polymers, silicone, mineral oils, etc. Definitely not ingredients you want on your lips and that are ingestable. I threw it away after 3 applications.",0
This company tests on animals and is not cruelty free. Spend the extra $4 and purchase Tatchaâ€™s â€œThe Kissu Lip Mask.â€œ Better quality product from a much better company.,0
"Got the Pumpkin Spice one, and it burned my lips. I donâ€™t have sensitive skin, but it did not feel great.",0
"This did nothing as far as resolving dry vertical lines in lips. It really just sits on top never actually absorbing or even moisturizing. I guess it is a lip mask, but I kind of expected it to also moisturize and seep in just a little. Sticky feeling too.. itâ€™s the first product I actually trashed",0
Not sure what the hype was about.  Good marketing?,0
"I Love Laneige. The Gummy Bear and Original are my go to however this one was terrible, no vanilla smell or taste just an odd no smell or taste it also dried my lips out so fast. Not sure if its a different formula but this was a waste of money.",0
I cannot believe that the lip product that Iâ€™ve used and loved for so many years has cheapened their ingredients by adding coconut oil. So those who have an allergy or sensitivity have to look elsewhere.,0
"Read some reviews saying that the different â€œcolorsâ€œ werenâ€™t as effective than the original but thought that it couldnâ€™t be THAT different and purchased the Sweet Candy one anyways.... Itâ€™s garbage. I have been using it for months and even when I cake the product on my lips and sleep for 12 hours, my lips look just as bad the next morning. Only way this product does anything for my lips is if I use it every night without breaks and even then the difference is minimal. I purchased the full size after using sample sizes of the original on and off for years and finding it to be the only thing able to rescue my lips overnight. If I ever purchase this product again, no matter how tempting the fun scents are, I will buy the original.TLDR: stick to the original!",0
"Love this product in the vanilla flavor, but the mango makes your lips orange â€¦ had to return",0
"Guys please please save your money! My $3 container of vaseline works 1000% better than this has ever worked for me. This stuff sticks to everything and by the time youâ€™re in your bed itâ€™s rubbed off. Unfortunately, I wonâ€™t be purchasing again and iâ€™ll stick to my vaseline.",0
It doesnâ€™t have any sent and it doesnâ€™t moisture that good so save your money!! Buy some carmex instead...Ã‡a ne sent rien et Ã§a nâ€™hydrate pas bien non plus alors Ã©conomise ton argent et achÃ¨te un carmex Ã  la place!,0
"Purchased this product to help my my dry lips. However, it made my lips drier.",0
"2 years later, lips have never been so dry. Especially around my lips ahhh No more!!!",0
"Iâ€™ll start by saying Iâ€™m a huge fan of these and own nearly all of the flavors but the Mango was such a disappointment. There is no scent to it at all, it is too subtle for my liking.  The mask formula is the same we all know and love but this may as well be fragrance free. So sad.",0
Worst lip mask ever. It gave me a horrible reaction. I immediately returned it.,0
Not worth the hype. I have used this everyday for over a month and it hasnâ€™t made a difference with my lips. I thought it would help them not get so dry and nothing. Carmex works better for $20 less LOL.,0
"I am convinced that my prolonged use of this product has made my lips more prone to dryness. I was also on a set with professional makeup artists and they commented that every model they worked with with dry lips used this lip mask. I do not recommend, even though it feels great on your lips, i donâ€™t think its good for you in the long term use. I used this for two years and my lips have never been more dry and trying to find something to heal them has been challenging",0
I donâ€™t really get the hype for this product. I got it with my points and Iâ€™ve seen people use it so I thought â€œwhy notâ€ and I started using it and my lips feel dry. I donâ€™t really like it. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be really using it anymore.,0
my lips are so dry I hate this product it ruined my lips do not buy!,0
Overhyped. I think my lips have become more dry / chapped since using this.,0
"I was using this every day for a few weeks and then I noticed a breakout of dry skin on my upper and lower lips. My lips were so dry I couldnâ€™t smile all the way. I took a break from it to confirm if the mask was the cause, waited for my lips to heal and they immediately broke out again once I used the mask. I have oily skin so this is a really strange reaction for me.",0
"Gives an initial juicy gloss and shine which makes your lips feel plump.  After using it nightly for two weeks my lips feel so dry they burn.  My mistake not looking at the ingredients,  synthetic waxâ€™s/emollients arnt going to make your lips moisturized.  You will be better off buying a cocoa butter based lip balm for $3.",0
"Used this product for one week and some white bumps appeared on my lips. I initially thought it was a lip balm (that was I was wearing during the day). This product has such good reviews and I thought it would work out for me. I threw away my lip balm. The white bumps spread out and my upper lips was red and had a burning sensation that lasted 1 week. Once healed, I used the LaNeige Lip sleeping mask and the next morning the white spots were back and my upper lips was red and had the burning sensation again.The product is not eligible for a refund anymore. I did try the Vanillascent sample and it was fine. It might be only this one that doesnâ€™t go with my skin. I wish I tried the sample before buying the whole thing!  Highly recommend getting a sample first.",0
"Dries out my lips, really wanted to like this but I wake up with such dry lips when I use it",0
"This product sucks. I wanted to love it! Specially after seeinf this is what Karol G uses and it leaves her lips beautiful. It made my lips super super super dry! I kept an eye on my lips after every application, and it seemed that it made my lips worst every time. Now I have blisters and irritated lips. Could be due to my sensitive skin. As I said, I wanted to love it, but it didnâ€™t work out.",0
I tried it for a week and my lips were so dry all day long then I gave it a break for a while to see if maybe it was something else and the same thing happened when I tried again. Did not work at all for me.,0
"They changed the formula? Not sure but I got an outbreak ): also, didnâ€™t feel moisturizing. My lips remain dry. Aquaphor works better for me and is a cheaper alternative",0
"Did absolutely nothing for my lips. in fact when i wake up in the morning with this on, my lips feel drier than they did before. Save your money and just use vaseline or aquaphor. This is nothing more than overpriced dollar store chapstick in a jar.",0
This is the second time I bought this and i am utterly disappointed. The packaging seemed ok. Upon opening it wasnt a balm like consistency. Infact it was all water as if it had melted. I tried keeping it in a cold dry place too just so it would become ok. But it dint work. The smell was no where close to what it usually smells like. Not sure what went wrong. Was so disappointed that literally trashed it after trying to fix it for a week.,0
Surprisingly made my lips dryer! I donâ€™t recommend!,0
"This product was ALL over TikTok, so I decided to give it a try. After using it every night for about two weeks I noticed myself reaching for chapstick during the day and/or licking my lips way more frequently, which I almost never do. I realized this product was the only thing different in my routine. I went back to using Vaseline or Aquaphor at night and my lips bounced back to normal. This is overpriced for no results. Iâ€™ll stick to the basics.",0
I have the mint choco version and I love it. This has such a strong perfume taste itâ€™s gross. I canâ€™t do it.,0
Broke my lips out had bumps and dark spots after 3 nights of use I do not recommend,0
I used this for about two weeks before I noticed the corners of my lips getting extremely dry and cracked. My lips started to peel. I stopped using it and they got better in a few days. Sad because I loved the scent.,0
"This product has so much hype so I finally bought it, and tbh it didnâ€™t live up to my expectations! I find itâ€™s drying after ten minutes! Nothing compared to my lip oils",0
"This new flavour does not smell or taste sweet at all. It is like perfume or lotion on your lips. I had to remove it right away. Too strong and a scent/taste that should not be on your lips, IMO.",0
Do nothing â€¦.simply waste of money wonâ€™t recommend to anyone,0
I used up the trial size of the one from last years birthday gift. After two months of consistent use I can say that this does absolutely nothing. Vaseline and staying hydrated(drink your water) will give you much better results. Definitely not with the price tag.,0
Literally does not work at all. I get better results from pharmacy lip balm,0
Lip mask in general are just do gimmicky. They donâ€™t work and my glossier bomb dot com hydrates my lips for much longer. $22 for a product that doesnâ€™t work is a waste of money,0
"Wanted to love! Needed a good lip mask for the winter and tried it for about a week. It has left my lips dry and more chapped than before I started using it. I wake up in the morning with my lips super dry and sore. Unfortunately canâ€™t return since have used, but will not purchase again.",0
Was super excited to try the product smells amazing but does nothing to keep my lips moisturized. Aquaphor works 10 times better and half the price.,0
"This product is so overhyped. Every time I use this, I wake up with dry lips. Doesnâ€™t moisturize at all. Makes them worse. Strongly encourage aquaphor.",0
Honestly thought this was going to be way better than it was. The product just dries my lips out even more.,0
Lol trash. I woke up with lips that were drier than before.,0
I donâ€™t understand the hype about this.  Itâ€™s just a very expensive lip balm.,0
Wanted to love this but it made my lips dry and sticky...,0
"I used this nightly for a month or so, I liked the feeling of this product when it was first applied but I found it to be very drying once it absorbed into my lips. I ended up disliking this product and have other lip products that I much prefer.",0
"This is the most average product, and clearly has hype around it due to the packaging. It sits on your lips, and does not penetrate them at all. In all honesty, immediately I want to wipe this off my mouth because it just feels like a thick paste just sitting there. Save your money.",0
I prefer Aquapfor healing ointment over this.Cheaper and best for me.,0
"The velvet exterior of the palette is prone to picking up dirt and stains. It's disappointing that the packaging doesn't hold up well over time, especially considering the price of this product",0
"I experienced a significant delay in receiving my Sephora order. It took nearly two weeks for my package to arrive, and the lack of communication about the delay was frustrating",0
"My order was marked as delivered, but I never received it. Dealing with Sephora's customer service to resolve the issue was a lengthy and frustrating process.",0
"The delivery driver mishandled my package, causing one of the items to be damaged. It was disappointing to receive a damaged product due to poor handling.",0
"I paid for express shipping, but my order still took longer than expected to arrive. The extra cost for expedited shipping didn't seem to make a difference.",0
The delivery arrived with items missing from my order. It was frustrating to have to go through the process of reporting the missing items and waiting for them to be resent.,0
"I received the wrong shade of foundation in my order. It was inconvenient to have to go to a physical Sephora store to exchange it, especially when I had opted for online shopping for convenience.",0
"The delivery was left at my doorstep without a signature confirmation, even though I requested one. This left me concerned about the security of my package",0
"I received a notification that my order had been delivered, but it didn't actually arrive until the next day. It was frustrating to receive conflicting information about the status of my delivery.",0
"The delivery packaging was damaged, and one of the products inside was partially crushed. It was disappointing to receive a damaged product due to inadequate packaging",0
"I paid for two-day shipping, but my order arrived a day later than promised. The delay meant I didn't have my products in time for the event I needed them for. This was a letdown considering the extra cost for expedited shipping",0
"I wanted to like this so bad! It seems to work well for so many people. For some reason all it does to my lips is make them scaley and scabby, really dry feeling and uncomfortable like thereâ€™s a matte lipstick on them. Im curious as to whether or not anyone else has had this problem? Maybe Iâ€™m slightly allergic to some ingredient in it? Anyway, I hope it works for yâ€™all but I guess be aware that it doesnâ€™t work for everyone Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯",0
It does what itâ€™s supposed to which is moisturizer but it didnâ€™t work as well as I thought. Iâ€™ve struggled with chapped lips for years and years because of where I live and yes Iâ€™m always well hydrated and what not but this didnâ€™t work any differently than my Vaseline and it was a waste of my money,0
Iâ€™m not sure why this got so popular. I have seen no results with this mask. If anything my lips are drier! I scanned the label on the Yuka app and it got a 0/100. Many harmful ingredientsâ€¦ does nothing for lip care.,0
"I donâ€™t write reviews unless I have a really positive or negative experience, and I donâ€™t understand hype around this at all. I wanted to love this after reading the reviews. I used it nightly for two months. I stuck with it, thinking maybe it just took some time.. itâ€™s not cheap, I wanted to give it a shot. If anything my lips are worse. My upper lip in particular gets so dry and sensitive with this. Literally Vaseline would have been better. Save your money and your lips.",0
The gummy bear one stained all my sheets!!! I love the original one but the purple one is just too pigmented :(,0
"Iâ€™m not sure how this has so many good reviews, as I used this as directed for a couple of nights and saw no improvements in my chapped lips. Save your $ and buy Aquaphor instead. Very disappointed in my purchase.",0
Overrated. Have given it a good try....apply several times in evening and liberally overnight but lips continue to crack and peel. buy a lip scrub.,0
I love lip products but this would definitely be near the bottom of my list.Its very stick/goopy and stays on my lips for about an hour at most. Only good thingI can say about this is that it is light weight has has a good smell.,0
Iâ€™ve seen so many rave reviews of this that I wanted to try it. Didnâ€™t see the results it said and after a few hour skating in bed with it in my lips were already dry. There was no leftover residue whatsoever in the morning. Kind of disappointed it didnâ€™t work better. I also didnâ€™t like the gummy feeling on your lips. I will give it one star for the smell but that is it.,0
I really wanted this mask to work for me. It just feels like it does a superficial job of hydrating my lips. My lips still feel dry the next morning. The bite agave lip masks has been the best for when my lips get too dry and no chapstick helps long term.,0
I was expecting some really great results but this just didnâ€™t do it for me. Especially for $26! I wanted to see if I was being dramatic so I put Vaseline on my lips overnight and to me my lips felt better waking up with that. & Vaseline is much cheaper so Iâ€™ll stick with that. I will be returning.,0
My lips are still dry in the morning. My Hurraw lip balm works better. I donâ€™t see how this is a mask. Itâ€™s more like a gloss.,0
i got a sample from the birthday kit and itâ€™s so frustrating! seeing all of the good reviews made me have high hopes for laneige however in reality once applying the mask it only stays on your lips for 30 minutes before drying them out again.,0
"Similar to a few other reviews, I unfortunately also found this lip mask to be very drying and irritating to my lips :( it feels lovely when applied... but my lips are dry, tight and irritated in the morning. The irritation will last a day or two with discontinued use. I typically just use Burtâ€™s Bees without issue, so wondering if the fragrance in this product might be the culprit? Not sure, but unfortunately wonâ€™t be using this any longer as a result of the irritation.",0
"My lips were 100% fine but I tried this out & they became DESERT DRY, DARK, & CHAPPED!! Simply horrible.",0
i wanted to like this product so much so when they discontinued the lip mask i use i tried this one. after using it for two weeks my lips are dryer than they have been since i was 6 and i didnâ€™t know what chapstick was. since then i have stopped using this in my night routine and am looking for alternatives,0
"So disappointed. I had high hopes for this product but it fell way short! Itâ€™s basically the consistency of Vaseline, goopy, and did nothing to improve the moisture in my lips. Itâ€™s absolutely not worth the price.",0
"I use it daily, sometimes twice and the lips have only gotten worse.",0
"I bought this to use as a regular lip balm because my lips are so dry and flaky, but it did nothing for me. It doesnâ€™t moisturize my lips at all, it just adds shine.  I do appreciate that there is a lot of product in the jar, but overall it is not worth the money at all.",0
I got this free as a birthday gift and noticed I would wake up and after washing off my lips would be super dry. After about 2 weeks I noticed my lips started to show little white bumps. Going back to using my natural lips balms they work way better.,0
Itâ€™s good - just nothing special. Itâ€™s expensive Vaseline. Itâ€™s nice on your lips and does moisturize but itâ€™s definitely not a mask. I use it during the day and have to constantly reapply it. I donâ€™t see a difference in my lips either.,0
"I have serious dry lips in the California winter and this does not touch them overnight.  Itâ€™s fine as a shine over the course of an hour or so, but overnight, aquaphor is so so much better as an overnight ointment.  This does absolutely nothing to soothe chapped lips long term.  Disappointed.",0
Doesnâ€™t work any better than Vaseline. Over priced and not worth it!,0
"If you are buying this because you have dry or chapped lips, donâ€™t do it. It provides no nourishment for your lips. If you donâ€™t have chapped lips and just want to use it as a balm, it does add shine.",0
The hype was real about this product. I was excited to try and woke up with the driest lips I have ever had. I am super disappointed. My lips are super uncomfortable now for sure not for me.,0
I want to love it but it dries out my lips. Iâ€™ve put it on when my lips are find and wake up and theyâ€™re flakey. It also causes cold sores like no tomorrow. I never â€œdouble dipâ€ so the risk of continuation from a previous sore is 0 yet Iâ€™ve noticed every time I use it I get a cold sore. And I rarely get them. Maybeeeee 1 a year max! And Iâ€™ve gotten 3 in 2 months.,0
Got this because my lips were chapped and this made it even worse!,0
"Received as part of the birthday gift set. Made my lips much worse; super dry, cracked, painful and started to discolor my lips. I gave it a good try for a few weeks. I finally had to stop using and went back to my previous routine and my lips healed up after a few days. It must be one of the ingredients that is common in these lip masks that just donâ€™t work for me, because I have tried others from cheap to expensive and all of them make my lips worse.",0
This mask really dried out my lips. Very disappointing product. I used as directed but wonâ€™t be using again. Sticking with Burts Bees lip balm going forward!,0
I thought this would be a good choice for dry winter lips but nope its so sticky and gross. It almost feels like glue. It smells nice though. Thats pretty much it nothing special and it has a lot of strange ingredients.,0
This honestly made my lip dry when it wasnâ€™t prior to applying it.,0
"i simply donâ€™t understand why everyone is raving about this product. i have a mini berry version that iâ€™ve had for a while now. i remember using it at first and noticing that my lips were extremely dry, so i set it to the side and forgot about it. recently, this product has gotten super popular. i pulled it out again and used it for the past two nights and itâ€™s just as i expected. my lips were more prone to peeling and are very dry. iâ€™m confused on why people are loving this stuff??definitely read the reviews first before purchasing. thereâ€™s lots of better alternatives in my opinion. this product is overhyped and overpriced for sure!",0
"this product dried out my lips so bad, drugstore lip balms work 100% better",0
I was really excited to try this product after reading reviews from personal friends and online. Unfortunately this product did not work for me. I used frequently for 5 days and my lips felt great with the product on but the next morning they were very dry and cracked. Will be returning and sticking with lanolin.,0
Not really a sleeping mask high hopes on this product for me was just a lip balm,0
"I wanted to like this so bad, but it did nothing for me. I donâ€™t know how to describe it, but I felt moisture outside of the lips, but not inside. It felt like putting water on my lips and how it feels good for a second, but then nothing. Also after waking up, my lips felt and looked more dry than they were before. I was really upset about this after all the good reviews I have heard, but everyoneâ€™s body is different. This just didnâ€™t work for me.",0
I wanted to love it but it honestly dries my lips out. Sticking to aquaphor for now.,0
Mehhhhh... nothing a good chapstick couldnâ€™t manage.  I was excited to try it but super disappointed.,0
Not worth the money. My Saje $8 coconut lip balm is SO MUCH BETTER. Do not waste your money.,0
"I really wanted to love this. Iâ€™ve heard such good things about it from others and for the week I used it I thought it would be the same. When I put it on itâ€™s very soft but when I wake up in the morning my lips are drier than they were before. I didnâ€™t realize the product was the thing doing it until I read other reviews saying the same thing. Very disappointed but glad I got it as part of my birthday gift and not purchasing the whole thing. I know it works for others so I say if you can get a sample, try it because you never know! Not for me but thatâ€™s ok.",0
"I am one of those rare people who will almost always take the time to write a good review and will rarely write a bad one unless itâ€™s BAD. Well, this is bad. I truly cannot understand the hype and awards on this stuff! It has cheap ingredients that are known irritants - artificial fragrance, colors and flavors and BHT! Super cheap ingredients too. Iâ€™m a skincare junkie and always research ingredients but I bought this in a whim because EVERYONE was raving about it online and I just donâ€™t get it. I often have dry, chapped lips despite drinking tons of water and have used dozens of lip balms and treatments over the years with far better results than this. I used this for several weeks and it made my lips drier in the morning EVERY TIME. It also made them itch - likely due to the added fragrance and flavor. Or the essential oils. Who knows. I know everyoneâ€™s skin is different but this is truly a terrible product with cheap ingredients. Ugh",0
Works but I canâ€™t love it. I found out itâ€™s not a cruelty free brand:(,0
I am a huge lip product lover and have tried hundreds of lip balms and lip glosses. Iâ€™m also the kind of person who has so wear lip balm when going to sleep so that I wake up with soft lips. I tried this lip balm for a week every night and every morning I woke up to dry lips! I hated the gross berry scent and the formula just felt weird on my lips. There are so many better lip balms out there. I just donâ€™t understand the raving reviews and the hype? Have people never even tried Vaseline before? This Laniege balm is the worst!,0
I wanted so much to love this product because it smells so wonderful but it has been drying out my lips so horribly. I wake up with dry chapped lips that feel like sandpaper. Perhaps I got a defective batch.,0
I brought this product because in the winter time my lips are not the best. I always switch up during the winter and have to keep my lips moisturized. This product smells cheap and the recovery for better lips is a complete lie. I brought the entire set and if it was good I was going to buy this for the family. I try the product out for 2 weeks and all my lips did was peel This is a bad product and very ghetto 1 Star would not recommend,0
Truly the worst lip mask/balm I have ever tried. I used it for 2 weeks consistently and it completely dried out my lips. DO NOT buy this product. The only good thing about it is that it smells really nice... but that is it.,0
This lip mask left my lips completely chapped. It is not worth the money and does the opposite of what it claims to do. Youâ€™re better off wearing a regular chapstick at night than ruining your lips with this stuff!,0
"I have been wanting to try this product for awhile as I live in Canada and our harsh winters are known for causing chapped lips. I received the lip mask as part of the bday package so I was glad to try out for free. Like other reviewers said, after using the product my lips were worse (more dry and cracked) than the day before. How?? The product applies like petroleum jelly so it feels like it will be hydrating but the next day my lips are a mess. I wonder if la neige fudged the formula for the bday samples? Definitely didnâ€™t sell me on it, will be sticking to EOS blistex and Burtâ€™s bees thanks.",0
"This product might be ok for lips, but it is a sticky, goopy mess. Itâ€™s like glue. I have to scrub my finger with soap after putting it on and it still doesnâ€™t all come off. Forget putting it by your bedside or without a sink nearby.",0
I was so excited to purchase this product as someone whoâ€™s never tried it before but could not escape the hypeâ€¦ and I am so disappointed. My lips may look moisturized after applying it for the first 5 minutes but before you know it my lips look and FEEL twice as dry as they did before I put it on.,0
"The original works, not this one though. This one was drying and didnâ€™t have the vanilla fragrance.",0
"From the ingredients list: Polybutene: Used in cosmetics as a plasticizer. Derived from petroleum. Also used for manufacturing adhesives. I donâ€™t care how well this is purported to work, Fossil fuel Petro products Do NOT go on my face. Iâ€™m so tired of having to go thru ingredients lists for this kind of thing.",0
"As excited I was to get this and use it, I was unfortunately disappointed. It did nothing as far as hydrating over night. I used it for 3 weeks before I gave up trying. Iâ€™m eczema prone so Iâ€™m not sure if this just wasnâ€™t strong enough to help, Vaseline still did the trick",0
Iâ€™ve been using this for six weeks semi-regularly. I get chapped lips a lot and thought this might be the way to heal them. But it didnâ€™t do anything! My lips are just as chapped in the morning as they were the night before. I have better luck with a lip scrub and vaseline than I do with this,0
"My lips are ALWAYS dry, living in dry Alberta doesnâ€™t help.  I was really excited to receive this in my birthday gift thinking it would be a great product. First, it was quite perfumey which concerned me as I donâ€™t really want perfume in a deep conditioning product - especially on the lips.  I applied a very thick layer as directed and went to bed. The next morning I had a terribly cracked lip. My lips are always dry but Iâ€™ve never had them crack until using this product.  Wonâ€™t be using again.  For reference, my absolute favourite hydrating lip product is the Jack Black shea butter lip balm. Nothing can compare to it!!",0
Iâ€™ve got the sample for my birthday and i was expecting a lot of this product because i really like Laneige but i HATED it. My lips were normal when i use it and next morning my lips were super dry and chapped. I tried it three times and each time the results were the same.,0
Feels like its moisturizing your lips... but itâ€™s really just sitting on top. Would not buy again. Made my lips dryer,0
"I really wanted to like this one but itâ€™s not very good. It kind of dries my lips out and scent-wise, itâ€™s so faint it essentially has no scent.  I have 4 of the others and theyâ€™re all great, but this one is a hard no. Overpriced as well.",0
Skip this one if you have sensitive skin. I usually buy the original or sweet candy flavors and like them a lot but this one burns like a lip plumper. It left my lips red and dry.,0
"I got this as a birthday gift and itâ€™s actually horrible. My lips werenâ€™t chapped when I applied it, but when I woke up in the morning they were chapped. Iâ€™m so disappointed. Youâ€™re better off with simple lip balm this mask is awful. The only positive thing I can say is that I liked the scent.",0
I donâ€™t typically have super chapped lips but after using this my lips were constantly very dry and chapped. Wouldnâ€™t recommend this product to anyone.,0
I tried this a few times and ended up throwing it away. It smells AMAZING and feels ok when you put it on but every time I used it I woke up with dryer lips than I started with.,0
"I usually love this product and I still do. However, this is getting one star because the Peach Iced Tea version has no discernible smell at all. I could have just bought plain fragrance laneige because thatâ€™s what I got.",0
"I donâ€™t understand the hype with this product, it makes my lips peel.Iâ€™ve used it per directionsamd my lips still flake. Aerin Rose lip conditioner is a far superior product! If youâ€™re looking for a miracle lip saver check out Aerin.",0
"I got this product after seeing reviews about how good it was. Yes there were bad reviews but the good ones were way more. I have been struggling with my lips and have been looking for a product that would help. Even though this is pricy I chose to get it as I thought it would help. It did not! I woke up to my lips incredibly dry, even more than before, and chapped to the point that would bleed????? This did not usually happen to me so it shocked me when it happened due to this product. I dont know if its cause I got peppermint flavor or not, but I do not recommend. I have been using it for a couple nights now to see if its effect would improve but no, still woke up with the same incredibly dry lips. I do not recommend at all, my lips hurt now from all the cracks.",0
"Would give 0 stars if possible. I am thoroughly disappointed in the product. Was given as a free gift when I signed up with Sephoraâ€™s beauty insider program a few days ago. After two nights of use I noticed some discolouration on my lower lip. It is very obvious and I am extremely upset. Especially since my lips were fine and I did not seek out the product, a sales representative recommended it to me. I was probably given an older product or something. I have worn lip balm all my life and I have never gotten this reaction.",0
be aware if you have any sensitivity.  this scent burnt my lips like a lip plumper would. would not recommend,0
Iâ€™m the type of person that doesnâ€™t mind spending money on anything but this is just not worth the price. This is literally just Vaseline. It doesnâ€™t smell like anything when you put it in your lips. Truly not worth it .,0
Doesnâ€™t hydrate anymore than say putting Vaseline on before bed. If anything I think it dries my lips out.,0
So disappointed it smells nothing like gingerbread or ginger anything more caramel but very faint barely any smell will be returning,0
The only thing I can say I like is the smell and texture of this lip mask. Thereâ€™s so many better options and it absolutely only dries my lips out. Disappointing.,0
My mum gave me this product from her Sephora birthday gift this year. I tried it out a week ago and by morning my lips were drier than anything and peeling terribly. It took my lips several days to recover. Itâ€™s possible I have a sensitivity to one of the ingredients but if you have sensitive skin I definitely donâ€™t recommend this product.,0
"I woke up with more moisturized lips when I lathered some of my favorite hand lotion on my lips before going to bedâ€¦ And it was cheaper! This product just feels like you got it from a la senza store. Smells extremely strong (but if you like lotions with heavy sweet smells shouldnâ€™t be a problem) and really no moisturizing qualities at all- especially for something they call a â€œmaskâ€. As with most other Laneige products, absolute disappointmentâ€¦ I would suggest Milk Makeupâ€™s melatonin lip mask over this any day.",0
Thereâ€™s no smell no flavour and the lid wasnâ€™t even screwed on properly when it arrived. Iâ€™m pretty dissatisfied and disappointed Would not recommend that you get this scent/flavour. Iâ€™ve had a better experience with the sampler of Miniâ€™s,0
"I really wanted to like this product, but I have to agree; itâ€™s sticky and makes my lips chapped. It doesnâ€™t even have much scent for berry â€œflavor.â€  Iâ€™ll stick with Vaseline; so much cheaper and works much better!! This was a waste of money.",0
"This does nothing!!!!!! It is a waste of time, money, and effort. I love most products from this brand, this is useless!!!",0
"Used twice and it made my lips chapped. I havenâ€™t had chapped lips in ages. For the price point, this is really embarrassing. You can get a better, more moisturizing product for 1/6th the price. Also please note that Sephora is selling this product for more than it usually retails for.",0
"PLEASE avoid if you have sensitive or very dry and reactive lips. Not only is it difficult to coat on and incredibly sticky, it wears off much quicker overnight than plain old Vaseline so itâ€™s not very moisturizing. Itâ€™s worth saying that after a while of not using it, reapplying it actually blistered my lips and stripped the skin off. It took me four months to repair the damage to a manageable level with prescription topical cream, and itâ€™s still not 100%. *But* as noted, I have VERY sensitive lips and sometimes get eczema flareups, so if youâ€™re anything like me, please donâ€™t risk it. This obviously wonâ€™t be most peopleâ€™s experience!",0
"i wanted to order the peach but after reading reviews I decided on the Berry. The reviews stated Peach had no scent and Berry smelled delightful. However, I found no scent to the Berry, or I received a bad batch. I will not order again unless they reach out and make this right. I will update if they do.",0
Made my lips very dry and crusty after one use. I do not recommend.,0
This feels sticky on my lips and the â€™berryâ€™ flavour smells like bubblegum. Yuck.,0
"I donâ€™t notice any improvement, It honestly didnâ€™t even feel like it was nourishing or moisturizing.  I wouldnâ€™t recommend spending money on it where I literally didnâ€™t notice anything. But I also do not suffer from dry lips, But my Lips didnâ€™t change a bit from not using this so itâ€™s better off to just save your money and just buy a cheap natural stick.",0
"Smells amazing, did nothing. Itâ€™s very messy. Beautiful packaging though.",0
"Just put some essential oil and skin-safe colourant in some vaseline and you have the same product. 100% regret buying this, got sucked in by how cute it was.",0
"I dont really get the point of this product.  It smells nice but it hasnt had any visible impact on my lips after about a month of use.  By the time i wake up in the morning all of the product is gone and my lips look the same. I dont really know if its working or not. I feel like for the price, might as well just use a way cheaper normal lip balm. It does smell nice and the texture feels good though. maybe since im a skincare novice the results are too sublte to notice.  I have a ton of this product left- it doesnt hurt to use so Iâ€™ll continue to use it but probably wont purchase again.",0
I DONT GET THE HYPE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IT DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IT DOESNT CURE MY DRY LIPS EVEN IF IT DOES IT DOES ONLY FOR AN HOUR N THEN THEY GO BACK TO BEING DRY THIS PRODUCT SUCKS YALL RAVING OVER SOME CRAP HERE,0
"I was really excited to try this after researching best lip masks and seeing a lot of positive reviews, but it did nothing for me! It smells good, but did not hydrate my lips AT ALL. So disappointing.",0
"One star because I do love the formula - but there is absolutely zero scent to this mask. Itâ€™s unfortunate as I was hoping peach iced tea would be great in the summer! Ah well, now I have a scent free version of the lip sleeping mask. Save your money OR buy a difference scent that actually smells!!",0
"Not worth the hype. Itâ€™s basically vaseline (only somehow stickier) that smells good. It sits on the lips but doesnâ€™t seem to hydrate at all. Gets one star because it does smell good, but otherwise not worth the price.",0
"I had high hopes for this product, but was quit disappointed. It is very sticky, and I still woke up with dry, flaky lips. At this price point, it should be a miracle worker, but it is not as good as less expensive lip balms (e.g. Kiehlâ€™s #1). Iâ€™m glad I got this as a sample before wasting my money.",0
"I usually love these , and was very excited about the peach smell. But then I got it and it has no smell at all? Pretty disappointed",0
"Completely unscented as many reviewers have mentioned. Definitely a formulation issue on the companyâ€™s end. Not sure why this product ever made it to market. I like every other scent of this product that Iâ€™ve tried but this one is absolutely a dud. At least it still works as a lip mask and is moisturizing. If youâ€™ve ever wished the lip mask was available in a flavorless/unscented formula, give it a try",0
"Except for smelling good, the mask does literally nothing. It just makes a sticky layer on my lips, but there is no hydration at all.",0
"I have almost every flavor of the Leneige Lip Masks and love them, howver this one is awful! It was a complete waste of money. There is hardly any scent compared to the rest. It feels the same so it â€œ worksâ€œ, but for the price I expect more. I would NOT recommend this flavor at all!! Skip it.",0
"Heard great things and was super excited to try it but unfortunately ended up being very disappointed. It smells amazing and applies nicely, but the following morning my lips were not any more hydrated, extremely sticky, and it left little bumps of residue on my lips that i had to scrub off. not worth the expense IMO. I liked nivea better for a quarter of the price.",0
"I love this product and was so excited for the Peach Tea flavor. However, I had the same issue many others seemed to have. There was NO scent at all. I returned it sadly. Get it, just not that flavor.",0
I just donâ€™t understand the appeal... my lips feel drier after using.,0
"Iâ€™ve got this in three other flavors and love all of them, so I was super excited for this one! Bought it within minutes of it launching. But no! No. It has absolutely no scent. I saw another reviewer on here say itâ€™s â€œsubtleâ€œ but Iâ€™d thatâ€™s not even it. I genuinely thought I got a product that hadnâ€™t had the fragrance added. There is no scent whatsoever. I went to smell a candle just to make sure my sense of smell wasnâ€™t wonky! It has no discernible smell. So if youâ€™re buying the Peach Iced Tea just to get this flavor, skip it. The others are all infinitely better.",0
"This product just sits on your lips. Itâ€™s glossy and looks great; however, it did not moisturize my lips more than a lip gloss would. I do not recommend as a lip moisturizer.",0
Does nothing for my lips they are still dry at the beginning and end of the day,0
I can't help but feel disappointed with Sephora's marketing tactics. It seems like they're more focused on creating hype around their products rather than genuinely delivering on quality. The constant bombardment of flashy advertisements and influencer endorsements has left me skeptical about the true value of their offerings.,0
"Sephora's marketing team seems to rely heavily on hype and trends to sell their products. This leaves me wondering if they're more interested in making a quick sale rather than providing customers with reliable, high-quality options. I'd appreciate a more transparent and informative approach to product promotion.",0
"It's frustrating how Sephora's marketing team hypes up products to the moon and back, only for them to fall flat in reality. It feels like they're more interested in creating buzz than ensuring the products live up to the expectations they set. It's a letdown for customers who expect honesty and quality",0
"Sephora's marketing team needs to dial it down a notch. The constant push for new, ""must-have"" products creates a sense of urgency that often leads to impulse purchases. I'd prefer a more measured and considered approach that focuses on the actual benefits of the products rather than just building up hype",0
